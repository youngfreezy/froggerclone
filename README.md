# froggerclone

Clone of the classic arcade game frogger, in JavaScript :)

Download the project into a folder- after that open the index.html and the game will start.

Playing:

Enter the number of bugs/enemies you think you can handle at once!

Move your character in any direction with the arrow keys.  If you touch bug you will lose a life!  If you lose all your lives (hearts at the bottom) you lose the game :( 

If you make it up to the river (water at the top) You win! :-D

Have fun!
